# Portfolio of my Data Projects
Currently, there is one project in this portfolio: [Bikeshare Analysis](https://github.com/justaszie/Bikeshare-Analysis/)

In this project, I did a data cleanup and analysis using SQL and Google Sheets to help a fictional bikeshare service company convert casual riders to annual membership holders.

More projects are in the works... 👷‍♂️🏗️
