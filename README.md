# Portfolio of my data projects
Currently, there is one project in this portfolio: [Bikeshare Analysis](https://github.com/justaszie/Bikeshare-Analysis/)
In this project, I did a historical data analysis using SQL and Google Sheets to help a fictional bikeshare service company convert casual riders to annual membership holders.

More projects are in the works... 👷‍♂️🏗️
